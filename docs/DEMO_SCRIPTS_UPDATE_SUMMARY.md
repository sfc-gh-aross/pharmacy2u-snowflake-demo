## Vignette 3 Updates

### Demo Point 4: From ML to Business Action
**Enhancement**: Connected to real organizational listings

**Key Changes**:
1. Updated narrative to reference **actual published** Churn Risk Scores listing
2. Added specific workflow:
   - Search 'churn' in Data Products â†’ Private Sharing â†’ Listings
   - Find listing with documentation
   - Request access with approval workflow
   - Query using ULL
   - Join with campaign data

3. Strengthened "last-mile" message:

   - All within Snowflake, all governed

### Closing Summary Update
**Changed**: "internal collaboration through organizational listings" â†’ "a real internal marketplace with published organizational listings"

**Why**: Reinforces that this is a production-ready feature, not a concept

---

## Key Messaging Changes Across All Scripts

### Before
- "Internal marketplace" (concept)
- "Data product catalog" (table-based simulation)
- "Self-service discovery" (theoretical)

### After
- "**Real Snowflake organizational listings**" (actual platform feature)
- "**Published to internal marketplace**" (live in Snowsight UI)
- "**Discoverable via Uniform Listing Locators (ULL)**" (production-ready)

---

## Competitive Differentiation Enhancement

### New Talking Points Added

**Fabric's Gaps** (now explicitly called out):
1. No built-in internal marketplace
2. Manual SharePoint/Confluence documentation required
3. Email-based access request workflow
4. Separate admin tools for permission grants
5. No programmatic discovery capabilities
6. Data product duplication due to poor discoverability

**Snowflake's Advantages** (now emphasized):
1. Built into platform (no external tools)
2. Searchable marketplace UI
3. Self-service access workflow (request â†’ approve â†’ consume)
4. Automatically governed (policies apply without config)
5. Live shares (zero data movement, real-time)
6. Queryable via SQL for programmatic discovery

---

## Demo Timing Impact

**Vignette 1**: No change (14:30 total)
**Vignette 2**: +30 seconds (now 14:00 total) - Worth it for stronger impact
**Vignette 3**: No change (15:00 total)

**Total Demo**: Still within 45-minute target (43:30 active demo time)

## Action Items for Demo Delivery

### Before Vignette 2
- [ ] Ensure all three listings are published (already done)
- [ ] **Optional but recommended**: Add data dictionary and quick start examples to at least one listing via Snowsight UI
  - Use `docs/LISTING_ENRICHMENT_GUIDE.md` as reference
  - Patient 360 listing is best candidate (has 4 detailed examples)
- [ ] Practice navigating to Data Products â†’ Private Sharing â†’ Listings
- [ ] Know the ULLs by heart for smooth delivery

### During Vignette 2 Demo
- [ ] Click through to show at least one listing detail page
- [ ] Point out Support Contact, Approver Contact fields
- [ ] If data dictionary/examples added, showcase them
- [ ] Emphasize "real listings, not simulated" at least once
- [ ] Deliver the expanded competitive wedge with confidence

### Fallback Preparation
- [ ] Have `SHOW LISTINGS LIKE 'PHARMACY2U%';` query ready in worksheet
- [ ] Know how to navigate to DATA_PRODUCT_CATALOG table as SQL fallback
- [ ] Practice explaining ULLs conceptually if UI doesn't load

---

## Competitive Impact

**Before Updates**: "Snowflake has internal marketplace capabilities"
**After Updates**: "Snowflake has **real, production-ready** organizational listings that Fabric fundamentally cannot match"

This is a **critical differentiator** - organizational listings are a feature that Microsoft Fabric **does not have and cannot easily replicate**. The updates make this advantage crystal clear.

---

**Demo scripts updated and ready for delivery!** ðŸš€

**Next step**: Consider adding data dictionary and quick start examples to listings via Snowsight UI for maximum impact (reference: `docs/LISTING_ENRICHMENT_GUIDE.md`)
