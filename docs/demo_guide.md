## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: What about existing Power BI investments?**
A: Snowflake has native Power BI connector with DirectQuery support. Your existing dashboards work seamlessly.

**Q: How does this integrate with our Azure Data Lake?**
A: We demonstrated Snowpipe ingesting from ADLS Gen2. Native integration, no third-party tools needed.

**Q: What about data residency and GDPR?**
A: Snowflake on Azure UK region keeps all data in UK. Dynamic masking ensures GDPR compliance automatically.

**Q: Migration timeline and effort?**
A: POC in 2-3 weeks. Typical migration: 2-3 months vs. 6-12 months for Fabric. Lower risk, faster ROI.

**Q: Cost compared to current architecture?**
A: Per-second billing, automatic suspension, and storage compression typically result in 30-40% cost reduction.

## Emergency Procedures

### If Demo Environment is Down
- Use backup account (maintain separate backup)
- Switch to pre-recorded demo video
- Focus on business value discussion and whiteboarding

### If Network Issues
- Switch to offline slide deck with screenshots
- Emphasize architecture diagrams and business value
- Schedule technical demo for later

### If Query Fails
- Have backup queries ready to copy/paste
- Explain what should happen
- Move to next section smoothly
- "Let me show you the next capability while that completes"
