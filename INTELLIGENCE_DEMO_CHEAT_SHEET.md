## 💡 Key Talking Points

**Opening:**
> "I'm acting as Sarah, a marketing manager who doesn't know SQL. Currently, she waits 2-3 days for analyst support. Watch this..."

**During Q4 (THE MOMENT):**
> "In 10 seconds, we identified an actionable cohort worth millions. Traditional BI: 2-3 days. Here: **10 seconds**."

**Governance:**
> "Every query respects the masking and access policies we configured earlier. Intelligence doesn't bypass security - it inherits it."

**vs Fabric:**
> "Power BI Q&A requires copying data to Premium, separate security config, and £4,995/month. This is native, governed, serverless."

**Closing:**
> "Time to insight: 2-3 days → 10 seconds. SQL skills required → None. Team dependency → Self-service. This is true data democratization."

## 🎭 Body Language Tips

- **Q1-Q3**: Type confidently, explain briefly, move on
- **Q4**: Type slowly (build suspense), wait for result, **PAUSE**, point at screen, **let the numbers sink in**, then explain impact
- **Q5-Q6**: Quick pace, show versatility
- **Wrap-up**: Face audience (not screen), eye contact, emphasize business value

---

## 🚨 Backup Plans

**If slow response:** "The agent is querying 100,000 records right now - still faster than 2-3 day wait!"

**If query fails:** "Great teaching moment - let me refine..." [Use a verified query from list]

**If UI unavailable:** Use screenshots from `docs/screenshots/` OR show SQL manually

---

## 📊 Impact Numbers (Memorize These)

- **Time to insight**: 2-3 days → **10 seconds** = **25,920x faster**
- **User access**: 5 analysts → **50+ business users** = **10x democratization**  
- **Campaign velocity**: Weekly → **Daily** = **7x faster**
- **Cost**: £4,995/mo Power BI Premium → **Serverless** (pay per query)
